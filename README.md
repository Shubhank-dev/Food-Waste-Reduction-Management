This project was developed as part of a hackathon Web-e-stan to tackle food waste by connecting NGOs, food donors (such as restaurants and grocery stores), and volunteer taxi drivers for efficient food redistribution
Here we are connecting Food Donors, Food Acceptors and Transporters of Food through a single platform.

Homepage will contain information and stats like how much food is wasted on daily basis while millions of people remain hungry.
This Page will serve as a Eye-Opener for new visitors and will motivate them to donate and volunteer in this Food Revolution.
